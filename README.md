# The Great Movie Gallery

## Description

This application is meant for users to post their favorite movies of all-time. A user can paste in the url of the movie poster of their favorite movie, add the movie title, and select "Add Movie" to post the movie to the page. Once posted to the page, the movie can be "liked" using the 'favorite icon'. Each movie will display the number of people who have liked that movie! If a movie drops out of the user's favorites, it can be deleted from the page using the 'trashcan icon'.
